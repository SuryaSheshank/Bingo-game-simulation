# Bingo-game-simulation
Simulation of Bingo Game in Java using auto-generated numbers by the moderator and tickets for 'n' number of players using multithreading.
There is one Moderator and ‘n’ Players. The moderator displays 10 random numbers (between 0 – 50) on a display screen.
Each player is given a card containing 10 random numbers (between 0 - 50). 

Used concepts such as Multithreading,Generics and collections,Arrays,Proper Exception handling and Design patterns to achieve the simulation

The simulation can be implemented by loading all the classes to any IDE which supports java followed by running the main class
